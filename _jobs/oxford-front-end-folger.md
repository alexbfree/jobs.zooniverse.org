The Zooniverse Oxford team are looking for a front-end developer to lead the development of a new manuscript transcription project, in collaboration with the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.

## About the job

You will be building the front-end for an in-browser transcription app, allowing our volunteers to help transcribe the library's various manuscript materials. This will integrate with our existing back-end API to aggregate the data produced.

Ideally, you will have built other client-side apps using a modern Javascript framework in the past, and will have experience using CSS preprocessors as well. Our current range of projects are built using Spine / Backbone, AngularJS and React.

You will also be responsible for managing the project's development, from requirements gathering through to delivery.

The post is full-time and fixed-term for 6 months, and has a high probability of extension to other projects after that.

## Salary and perks

The job is rated at grade 7 on the University salary scale, or £30,434 to £40,847, depending on experience.

We also offer flexible working conditions, an excellent pension, and access to a huge range of discounts and deals through the University. A research budget for travel and other expenses is also available.
